# Decentralized Climate Assessment Platform (DCAP)

A blockchain-based platform for collaborative scientific assessment and modeling of climate interventions, focused on rigorous peer review and comprehensive impact analysis.

## Overview

The Decentralized Climate Assessment Platform (DCAP) provides infrastructure for climate scientists, researchers, and domain experts to collaboratively evaluate climate science proposals. The system emphasizes thorough peer review, transparent assessment processes, and comprehensive safety evaluation.

## Key Features

### Scientific Proposal System
- Structured submission framework for research proposals
- Required documentation of methodologies and safety considerations
- Comprehensive citation and reference tracking
- Integration with academic peer review standards

### Expert Review Network
- Verified expert credentials and domain specialization
- Multi-stage peer review process
- Conflict of interest management
- Transparent review metrics and feedback

### Simulation Infrastructure
- Distributed computing network for climate modeling
- Multiple validated climate models
- Uncertainty quantification
- Sensitivity analysis capabilities

### Impact Assessment Framework
- Multi-factor impact evaluation
- Risk assessment protocols
- Environmental monitoring integration
- Long-term effect modeling

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Core contracts:
ProposalRegistry.sol      // Manages proposal submissions
ExpertNetwork.sol         // Handles expert verification
ComputeCredit.sol         // Manages computation resources
AssessmentOracle.sol      // Validates assessment data
```

### Computation Layer
- Distributed compute node network
- Validated simulation environments
